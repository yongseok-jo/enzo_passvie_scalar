OneZoneFreefallTest
----------------

This test problem will set up a 2D grid varying in energy and metallicity.  
All points have the same density, which evolves according to the analytical 
solution for free-fall collapse.  The timestep is calculated as a fraction of 
the free-fall time.  Since the timestep continually decreases, outputs are 
done on cycles.  This test problem can be used to test chemistry and 
cooling routines.
