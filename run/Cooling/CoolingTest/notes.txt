CoolingTest
----------

These test problems will set up a single grid that varies smoothly in density, 
metallicity, and temperature, then iterate the rate equations in the chemisty 
module for 50,000 years with hydro deactivated.  The code will make an 
output at the end of the run that includes the cooling time.  This problem 
type did not exist in Enzo 1.5, so there is no comparison.

The cooling tests will run in a few minutes on a single processor.

The three parameter files are:
CoolingTest_MS1.enzo - uses the MultiSpecies = 1 atomic H/He chemisty
CoolingTest_JHW.enzo - uses John Wise's metal cooling along with 
		       	    	 	the MultiSpecies = 1 chemitry.
CoolingTest_Cloudy.enzo - uses Cloudy cooling along with the 
			       	      	    MultiSpecies = 1 chemistry.  The input data 
					    provided is a three dimensional table that 
					    varies in density, metallicity, and temperature.

Cooling data files:
primordial_cie.dat - CIE cooling rates for atomic H and He taken from 
		     	 	 Black (1981).
cool_rates.in - analytic cooling rates for Z = 0.5 and 1 Zsun from 
	      		Sarazin & White (1987).
metal_cool.dat - input data for John Wise's metal cooling.
solar_2008_3D_metals.h5 - input data for Cloudy cooling.

The script plot.py will plot cooling rates from the three cooling tests 
along with the H/He cooling rate from Black (1981) and the Z = Zsun 
rate from Sarazin & White (1987)
