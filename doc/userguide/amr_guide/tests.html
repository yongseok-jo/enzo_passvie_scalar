    <h1>Enzo: Running the tests</h1>
There are a number of built-in tests, which can be used to debug the system
or characterize how well it solves a particular problem.&nbsp; Note that
enzo can run any problem after compilation, since no compilation flags
affect simulation parameters (unlike the
hydrodynamics code <tt><a href="http://zeus.ncsa.uiuc.edu:8080/archives/software/general/kronos_manual/kronos_manual.html">KRONOS</a></tt>
for example)&nbsp; To run a particular test, cd to the <tt>amr_mpi/exe</tt>
(after compiling enzo) and use the following
command-line:
<p><tt>mpirun -np 1 enzo [-d] test_name</tt>
<p>The syntax of the mpirun various from mpi implementation.&nbsp; The
example given here comes from the Origin2000 and implies a single processor
(the argument after the -np flag indicates the number of processors.&nbsp;
<p>The parameter <tt>test_name</tt> corresponds to the parameter file that
specifies the type of test and the test particulars. This file is ascii,
and can be edited.&nbsp;&nbsp; It consists of a series of lines (and optional
comments) each of which specifies the value of one parameter.&nbsp;&nbsp;
The parameters are discussed in more detail in the section on 
<a href="http://cosmos.ucsd.edu/enzo-devel/parameters/index-enzo.html">parameters</a>.
<p>If you just type <tt>enzo</tt> without any arguments, or if the number
of arguments is incorrect, the program should respond with a summary of
the command-line usage.
<p>The <tt>-d</tt> flag turns on a rather verbose debug option.
<p>For example, to run the shock tube test, use:
<p><tt>mpirun -np 1 enzo ShockTube</tt>
<p>or
<p><tt>enzo ShockTube</tt>
<p>The response should be:
<p><tt>Successfully read in parameter file ShockTube.</tt>
<br><tt>Successful completion...</tt>
<p>&nbsp;The tests are:
    <ul>
      <li>
	ShockTube</li>
      
      <li>
	ShockPool</li>
      
      <li>
	WavePool</li>
      
      <li>
	ShockInABox</li>
      
      <li>
	...</li>
    </ul>

How do you know if the results are correct? We hope to add the ability for
the code to check against pre-computed results, but for the moment, if
the code doesn't crash, it's probably a reasonable bet that it is working
correctly (the other good check is that the shock tube run takes 68 or
69 steps). You may also wish to plot the results (<a href="output.html">output</a>
as HDF files).&nbsp;&nbsp; This section will be expanded in later editions
of this manual.
