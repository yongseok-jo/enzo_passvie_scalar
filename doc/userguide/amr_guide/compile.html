<h1>Enzo user's guide: compilation</h1>

    <h2>Compiling</h2>

<p>For instructions on the basic make options, go to the top-level enzo directory and type:</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<tt>make help</tt></p>

<p>
On systems you may have to use <tt>gmake</tt> instead of <tt>make</tt>.  If you get
errors complaining about the makefiles, try using the command <tt>gmake</tt>.
The compilation process is fairly straightforward.  Enzo is already pre-configured to
compile on most NCSA, SDSC and PSC machines.  While in the top-level directory, type:
</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<tt>./configure</tt></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<tt>make</tt></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<tt>make install</tt></p>

<p>
All portions of the code should automatically compile and executables should
be placed in the enzo-code/bin directory.  If you are compiling on non-NCSA machine you may have
to add extra makefiles in the config directory to get the code to compile correctly.
See the README in enzo-code/config for more information.  Instructions for
adding makefiles to get enzo to compile on a machine
type/architecture that isn't explicitly supported will be added at a later date.</p>

<p>The general philosophy of enzo is that all options are specified in the
parameter file at run-time, so that once the code is compiled it does not need
to be recompiled to run another problem or change a parameter.  There are some
compiler-time parameters, which can be seen by typing:</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<tt>make help-config</tt></p>

<p>This allows the user to specify the specific machine, the
desired precision of the code, the version of HDF, and various timing 
and optimization settings.  The code is parallelized using MPI, so 
compiler-based parallelization is NOT recommended.</p>
