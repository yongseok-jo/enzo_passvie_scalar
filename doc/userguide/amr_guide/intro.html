    <h1>Enzo Introduction</h1>
<p>
This document provides a brief description of the compilation and operation
of Enzo, a structured Adaptive Mesh Refinement (SAMR, or more loosely AMR) code
which is primarily intended for use in astrophysics and cosmology.  The User's Guide
is intended to explain how to compile and run Enzo, the initial conditions generation
code and the various analysis tools bundled with Enzo.  The instructions on actually
running the code are not comprehensive in that they are not machine or platform-specific.
Arguably the most useful and important piece of this guide is the 
<a href="index-enzo.html">parameter list</a>.
which contains descriptions of all of the roughly 300 possible input parameters 
(as of February 2004).  For more detailed information on the Enzo algorithms and on
running Enzo on different platforms,
you should refer to the <a href="../cookbook/index.html">Enzo Tutorial and Cookbook</a>.  Detailed
information on the algorithms used in Enzo will be available in the method paper (unreleased
as of February 2004).  In the meantime, look at the
 <a href="../publications.html#referee">publication list</a> for 
more concrete Enzo information.

This guide (and Enzo itself) was originally written by 
<a href="mailto:gbryan (AT) astro (dot) columbia (dot) edu">Greg Bryan</a>.  Since the original 
writing of both the simulation code and the User's Guide, the maintenence of Enzo and
its associated tools and documentation has been taken over by the
<A href="http://cosmos.ucsd.edu/">Laboratory for Computational Astrophysics</a> at
<a href="http://www.ucsd.edu/">The University of California, San Diego</a>.  Your input
in improving both the code and the User's Guide is appreciated.    Please send email to the
Enzo Development Listserv
 (<a href="mailto:enzo-l@ucsd.edu">enzo-l@ucsd.edu</a>) with any feedback.  Thank you!</p>
