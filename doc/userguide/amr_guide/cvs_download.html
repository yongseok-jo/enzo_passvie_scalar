<h1>Obtaining the Enzo package</h1>
<p>
All of the code described in these documents are available via using the 
<a href="http://www.cs.utah.edu/dept/old/texinfo/cvs/cvs_toc.html">Concurrent
Versions System</a> (CVS) software.  While somewhat more complicated than 
simply having a tar file available from a website, this allows users to 
immediately update their code to reflect code updates and bug fixes.  
As of February 2004 the code is available to both the public and to 
members of the LCA:  However, the public version is missing some features
that are available in the LCA version, such as star formation and feedback
and some cooling models.</p>

<p>Before installing enzo, you must ensure that CVS is installed on the target
system.  This is most likely true for any unix or unix-like system.  Just type 'cvs'
at a command prompt and if a help screen doesn't appear, contact your system
administrator.  To use CVS, first set the CVSROOT variable:

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<tt>setenv CVSROOT :pserver:login@jbpc.ucsd.edu:/usr/local/cvs_lca </tt>

<p>Where login is your user login.  Contact <a href="jbordner@cosmos.ucsd.edu">James Bordner</a> for access to the CVS repository.  You may also have to set CVS_RSH to use ssh instead of rsh:

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<tt>setenv CVS_RSH ssh</tt>

<p>These setenv commands assume that you use c shell or tc shell.  If you use bash or ksh, you're 
on your own.  After setting the environmental variables, log in to the server:

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<tt>cvs login</tt>
<p>[enter password at prompt]
<p>Then check out the code:
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<tt>cvs checkout enzo-code</tt>

<p>This will then download the entire enzo bundle to a directory called 'enzo-code'.
You must have about 10 megabytes of disk space available for the source, and an
additional 40 megabytes or so for the code to have space to compile.</p>
<p>You only have to do this checkout once to create a local copy of the repository.  
After the initial code checkout you merely have to go into the enzo-code directory 
and type:</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<tt>cvs update -d</tt>

<p>to get the latest version of the code.  It will merge changes/bugfixes
made by the Enzo code development group with your local copy.</p>

<p>To see what modifications have been made you can use:

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<tt>cvs history</tt>
<p>This command can also be used to remove these changes in order to 
recover the code to a previous state.</p>
