   <title>Enzo user's guide: compiling INITS</title>
</head>
<body>
<h1>Compiling the INITS package</h1>
INITS is a program used to generate cosmological initial conditions for
the single grid hydrodynamics code KRONOS and the adaptive mesh refinement
code Enzo. See the section on <a href="download.html">obtaining Enzo</a> 
for instructions on downloading inits. The routines will be in
a directory called <tt>inits</tt>.
<p>The compilation process uses a simple Makefile method in which a macro
set in the first few lines of the Makefile (<tt>MACHINE_NAME</tt>), specifies
a secondary Makefile (called <tt>Makefile.MACHINE_NAME</tt>) which contains
machine specific information. This is very similar to the way in which
Enzo is <a href="compile.html">compiled</a>. In fact the secondary
Makefiles should be interchangeable.
<p>If the machine you are running on is supported (i.e. it already has
a <tt>Makefile.MACHINE_NAME </tt>file), then generally you will only have
to specify the location of the <a href="http://hdf.ncsa.uiuc.edu/">HDF
library</a> (set with the <tt>LIB</tt> and <tt>INCLUDE</tt> macros). In
particular, the NCSA machines should require no changes for compilation.
If the secondary makefile does not exist for your machine type, then you
will have to create a new one, following an existing one as a model. See
also the discussion for the AMR code enzo.
<p>Once the <tt>MACHINE_NAME</tt> macro is set, compile with:
<p>&nbsp;<tt>make</tt>
<p>The executable <tt>inits</tt> should be created in the same directory.
