<p><a name="requirements"></a><b>Enzo Requirements</b><br>
Enzo is written in C++ and Fortran 77/90.  It is parallelized with 
<a href="http://www-unix.mcs.anl.gov/mpi/" target="_top">MPI v1.0</a>.  Enzo uses the 
<a href="http://hdf.ncsa.uiuc.edu" target="_top">Hierarchical Data Format (HDF)</a>.  
Enzo primarily uses <a href="http://hdf.ncsa.uiuc.edu/HDF5/" target="_top">HDF5</a>, 
though we maintain legacy support for 
<a href="http://hdf.ncsa.uiuc.edu/hdf4.html" target="_top">HDF4</a>.  
Enzo requires <a href="http://make.paulandlesley.org/" target="_top">GNU Make</a> 
for compilation.  In theory, Enzo can be compiled and run on any platform 
using a unix-based operating system that has all of the previously mentioned 
software installed.  Enzo is currently used on the NCSA IBM p690 and Itanium-2
systems and the SDSC IBM Power3 and p690 systems, as well as a multitude of
Sun, SGI, and Linux machines, as well as the Cray X-1.</p>
