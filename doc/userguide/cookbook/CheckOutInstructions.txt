= Subversion Check Out Instructions =

The latest public version of Enzo is available for anonymous checkout using [http://subversion.tigris.org/ Subversion]. This is where bug fixes and new features will appear between releases.

You also browse the source tree, either through the [http://mngrid.ucsd.edu/svn/Enzo/public default Subversion HTTP interface], or the nicer [browser:public Trac browser].

''A hint'': Before you try to build Enzo, you might want to make sure you meet the [wiki:UserGuide/CookBook/CompilationRequirements compilation requirements].

== Subversion Clients ==

To check out a local copy of the Enzo source, you need a [http://subversion.tigris.org/ Subversion] client. These are available as part of all recent Linux distributions; for other operating systems (OS X, AIX, etc.), binaries are available (there's a list of third-party clients on the [http://subversion.tigris.org/ Subversion front page]), or the client can be built from source. GUI clients are available, but these instructions assume you're using a command line client.

To see if you already have the client installed, use {{{which}}}.

{{{
ds001 $ which svn
/usr/local/bin/svn
ds001 $ 
}}}

If you don't have the client, and are a shared shared resource (a cluster, or supercomputer), please ask the system administrator to install Subversion for everyone. This will make things easier for the next user who comes along.

== Getting a Copy ==

FYI: Checking out Enzo will also get you a copy [http://yt.enzotools.org/ YT], the [http://www.python.org Python] based analysis toolkit. Check the [http://yt.enzotools.org/ YT website] for instructions on compiling and using [http://yt.enzotools.org/ YT].

Once you have the client, you can use it ''checkout'' a local copy.

{{{
ds001 $ svn checkout http://mngrid.ucsd.edu/svn/Enzo/public/trunk enzo
A    enzo/configure
A    enzo/doc
A    enzo/doc/flowchart

ds001 $  
}}}

And now you have a copy of the latest public version. Time to work on [wiki:UserGuide/CookBook/BuildingEnzo building Enzo].

== Updating ==

To update your local copy, you can use {{{svn}}} to pull down only the latest changes.

''Note'': If you've modified any files in your copy, this will merge changes from the trunk in to your working copy, which may generate conflicts. If you're doing development on Enzo itself, you may want to check the [log:public/trunk revision log] before doing an update.

{{{
ds001 $ cd enzo/
ds001 $ svn update
A    README

Fetching external item into 'src/yt'
Updated external to revision 731.

Updated to revision 1762.
ds001 $ 
}}}

Now, you can do a {{{make clean; make}}} and get back to work.
