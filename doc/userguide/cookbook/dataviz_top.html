    <h1>Data Visualization</h1>
    
    Several tools are available for making images from Enzo data:

    <h2>LCA Vision</h2>
    <p> LCA Vision is a free scientific visualization tool written at the 
      <a href="http://cosmos.ucsd.edu">Laboratory for Computational Astrophysics</a> while
      the group was at <a href="http://www.ncsa.uiuc.edu">The National Center for Supercomputing Applications</a>.
      It's a very powerful tool custom-designed to visualize AMR data.  The LCA Vision home page is
      <a href="http://zeus.ncsa.uiuc.edu/~miksa/LCAVision.html">here</a>.</p>

    <h2>Enzo Projection Tool</h2>
    <p>Enzo can make simple 2D projections (see <a href="../amr_guide/analyze.html#2D%20projections">this page</a>
      for information on how to make projections).  We have a <a href="showhdf5proj.pro">simple script</a> 
      written for <a href="http://www.rsinc.com/idl/index.asp">IDL</a> 
      (a commercial program made by <a href="http://www.rsinc.com/">Research Systems, Inc.</a>) which can be
      used to convert these images to jpeg.</p>

    <h2>Jacques</h2>
    <p>Additionally, one can use a visualization tool called 
      <a href="http://cosmos.ucsd.edu/~tabel/Jacques/">Jacques</a>, which is written by
      <a href="http://www.tomabel.com">Tom Abel</a>.  This code is also based on 
      <a href="http://www.rsinc.com/idl/index.asp">IDL</a>, and is currently only configured
      for HDF 4 datasets.  However, it can be modified to use HDF 5.</p>
    
    <h2>Other tools</h2>
    <p>We will post other useful visualization tools as they are made known to us.</p>
