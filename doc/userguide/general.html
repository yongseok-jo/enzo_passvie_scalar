<p><a name="description"></a><b>Description</b><br>
Enzo is an adaptive mesh refinement (AMR), grid-based hybrid code (hydro + N-Body) 
which is designed to do simulations of cosmological structure formation.  It uses 
the algorithms of Berger & Collela to improve spatial and temporal resolution in
 regions of large gradients, such as gravitationally collapsing objects.  The Enzo
 simulation software is incredibly flexible, and can be used to simulate a wide 
range of cosmological situations with the physics packages described below 
(see <a href="#features">Features</a>).</p>
<p>
Enzo has been parallelized using the MPI message-passing library and can run on 
any shared or distributed memory parallel supercomputer or PC cluster.  
Simulations using as many as 1024 processors have been successfully carried 
out on the San Diego Supercomputing Center's Blue Horizon, an IBM SP.

Enzo was released to the public on March 1, 2004.  To obtain a copy of the
code go to the <a href="software.html#download" target="right">download</a> page.

<p><a name="features"></a><b>Features</b><br>
The public release of Enzo includes (but is not limited to) the following physics:
    <ul>
      <li>N-body gravitational dynamics using the particle-mesh method
      <li>hydrodynamics using both the piecewise parabolic method (PPM) and the
	      finite-difference method used in the Zeus MHD code.
      <li>The capability to follow up to 9 species of H and He
      <li>Radiative cooling, using either an assumed metallicity or 
	calculated directly from species abundances
      <li>Uniform ultraviolet backgrounds based on work by Haardt & Madau
      <li>Fully Parallel I/O using the HDF5 data model
    </ul>

 Currently, Enzo is being developed by (in alphabetical order) Tom Abel, 
James Bordner, Greg Bryan, David Collins, Robert Harkness, Alexei Kritsuk, Brian O'Shea,
 Pascal Paschos and Alex Razoumov.  This team is led by Michael Norman, the director of the Laboratory
for Computational Astrophysics.
