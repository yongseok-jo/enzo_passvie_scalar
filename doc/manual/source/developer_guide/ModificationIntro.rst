Introduction to Enzo Modification
=================================

.. note:: This is not a comprehensive document, but it does cover some of the
          grounds of modifying Enzo.  Please don't hesitate to email the users'
          mailing list with any further questions about Enzo, Mercurial, or how
          to write and execute new test problems.

If this is the first time you've opened the hood to Enzo, welcome.  If you're
an old hand and have already added new physics to it, welcome back.

Enzo is an extremely powerful piece of software, but by no means a complete
representation of the observable universe. It's quite likely that there will be
some piece of physics that you'll want to model, and these span a broad range
of software complexities. In all cases, whether it's a mildly invasive change
such as a new background heating model or extremely invasive like adding
relativistic non-neutral multi-fluid plasma physics, we strongly recommend
taking advantage of some basic tools. These are outlined in the sections that
follow.  These tools prevent the developer from breaking existing features
(which is far easier than one would expect), keeping track of your changes, and
sharing those changes with others. We strongly recommend you start with getting
LCATest running before you start programming, so mistakes can be caught early.

Additionally in the Tutorials section you'll see a pair of flow chart tools
that are intended as educational tools, and several descriptions on how to
actually add various components to the code.  It is intended that these will be
at least read in order, as doing complex things with the code require the
ability to do the simpler things.

We are very happy to accept patches, features, and bugfixes from any member of
the community!  Enzo is developed using mercurial, primarily because it enables
very easy and straightforward submission of changesets.  We're eager to hear
from you, and if you are developing Enzo, please subscribe to the users'
mailing list:

This document describes how to use Mercurial to make changes to Enzo, how to
send those changes upstream, and how to navigate the Enzo source tree.

Mercurial Introduction
----------------------

If you're new to Mercurial, these three resources are pretty great for learning
the ins and outs:

   * http://hginit.com
   * http://hgbook.red-bean.com/read/
   * http://mercurial.selenic.com/

The major difference between Mercurial (and other distributed version control
systems) and centralized version control systems (like CVS, RCS, SVN) is that
of the directed acyclic graph (DAG).  Rather than having a single timeline of
modifications, Mercurial (or "hg") can have multiple, independent streams of
development.

There are a few concepts in Mercurial to take note of:

Changesets
   Every point in the history of the code is referred to as a changeset.  These
   are specific states of the code, which can be recovered at any time in *any*
   checkout of the repository.  These are analagous to revisions in Subversion.
Children
   If a changeset has changesets that were created from its state, those are
   called children.  A changeset can have many children; this is how the graph
   of development branches.
Heads
   Every changeset that has no children is called a head.
Branches
   Every time the DAG branches, these are branches.  Enzo also uses "named
   branches," where the branches have specific identifiers that refer to the
   feature under development or some other characteristic of a line of
   development.

On the Google Code wiki there is a list of active branches.

When you check out the Enzo repository, you receive a full and complete copy of
the entire history of that repository; you can update between revisions at
will without ever touching the network again.  This allows not only for
network-disconnected development, but it also means that if you are creating
some new feature on top of Enzo you can (and should!) conduct local version
control on your development.  Until you choose explicitly to share changes,
they will remain private to your checkout of the repository.

Enzo Source Trees
-----------------

Enzo has two primary repositories, the "stable" repository which is curated and
carefully modified, and the "unstable" repository which is where active
development occurs.  Please note that while we test and verify the results of
the "stable" repository, the "unstable" repository is not guaranteed to be
tested, verified, or even to provide correct answers.

Checkout instructions for the source tree can be found on the Enzo project page
on Google Code at http://enzo.googlecode.com/ .

How To Use Branching
--------------------

If you are planning on making a large change to the code base that may not be
ready for many commits, or if you are planning on breaking some functionality
and rewriting it, you are encouraged to create a new named branch.  You can
mark the current repository as a new named branch by executing: ::

   $ hg branch new_feature_name

The next commit and all subsequent commits will be contained within that named
branch.  At this point, add your branch here:

http://code.google.com/p/enzo/wiki/ActiveBranches

To merge changes in from another branch, you would execute: ::

   $ hg merge some_other_branch

Note also that you can use revision specifiers instead of "some_other_branch".
When you are ready to merge back into the main branch, execute this process: ::

   $ hg merge name_of_main_branch
   $ hg commit --close-branch
   $ hg up -C name_of_main_branch
   $ hg merge name_of_feature_branch
   $ hg commit

When you execute the merge you may have to resolve conflicts.  Once you resolve
conflicts in a file, you can mark it as resolved by doing: ::

   $ hg resolve -m path/to/conflicting/file.py

Please be careful when resolving conflicts in files.

Once your branch has been merged in, mark it as closed on the wiki page.

How To Share Changes
--------------------

If you do not have "push" rights on the primary mercurial repository, set up
and use the "patchbomb" extension in mercurial to email a bundle of changes to
the developer mailing list:

http://groups.google.com/group/enzo-dev

The patchbomb extension is documented here:

http://mercurial.selenic.com/wiki/PatchbombExtension

Please be sure to specify that you wish to send a bundle.  This can be
accomplished by setting up your hgrc to email the ``enzo-l`` mailing list and
executing the command: ::

   $ hg email -b

Be sure to read the output of ``hg help email`` before doing this.

The Patch Directory
--------------------

If you are experimenting with a code change or just debugging, then the patch directory, found in the top level of your Enzo directory, may be of use. Files put in here are compiled in preference to those in ``/src/enzo``, so you can implement changes without overwriting the original code. To use this feature, run ``make`` from inside ``/patch``.

As an example, suppose you wish to check the first few values of the acceleration field as Enzo runs through ``EvolveLevel.C``. Copy ``EvolveLevel.C`` from ``/src/enzo`` into ``/patch`` and put the appropriate print statements throughout that copy of the routine. Then recompile Enzo from inside the patch directory. When you no longer want those changes, simply delete EvolveLevel.C from ``/patch`` and the next compile of the code will revert to using the original ``/src/enzo/EvolveLevel.C``. If you make adjustments you wish to keep, just copy the patch version of the code into ``/src/enzo`` to replace the original.


How To Include Tests
--------------------

If you have added any new functionality, you should add it as a test in the
directory tree ``run/`` under the (possibly new!) appropriate directory.  Your
test file should consist of:

 * A parameter file, ending in the extension ``.enzo``
 * A file of ``notes.txt``, describing the problem file, the expected results,
   and how to verify correctness
 * A test file, using the yt extension ``enzo_test``, which verifies
   correctness.  (For more information on this, see some of the example test
   files.)
 * (optional) Scripts to plot the output of the new parameter file.

Please drop a line to the mailing list if you run into any problems!
