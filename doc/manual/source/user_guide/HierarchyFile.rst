The Enzo Hierarchy File - Explanation and Usage
===============================================

The Enzo Hierarchy file is a representation of the internal memory
state of the entire hierarchy of grids. As such, its format --
while somewhat obtuse at first -- reflects that context. Each grid
entry has a set number of fields that describe its position in
space, as well as the fields that are affiliated with that grid:

.. highlight:: none

::

    Grid = 1
    Task              = 4
    GridRank          = 3
    GridDimension     = 38 22 22 
    GridStartIndex    = 3 3 3 
    GridEndIndex      = 34 18 18 
    GridLeftEdge      = 0 0 0 
    GridRightEdge     = 1 0.5 0.5 
    Time              = 646.75066015177
    SubgridsAreStatic = 0
    NumberOfBaryonFields = 8
    FieldType = 0 1 4 5 6 19 20 21 
    BaryonFileName = ./RD0005/RedshiftOutput0005.cpu0000
    CourantSafetyNumber    = 0.300000
    PPMFlatteningParameter = 0
    PPMDiffusionParameter  = 0
    PPMSteepeningParameter = 0
    NumberOfParticles   = 20
    ParticleFileName = ./RD0005/RedshiftOutput0005.cpu0000
    GravityBoundaryType = 0
    Pointer: Grid[1]->NextGridThisLevel = 2

The final field, starting with "Pointer", is slightly more
complicated and will be discussed below.

``Grid = 1``

  This is the ID of the grid. Enzo grids are indexed internally
  starting at 1.

``Task = 3``

  This grid was written by processor 3 and will be read in by it if
  restarting more than 4 processors.

``GridRank = 3``

  This is the dimensionality of the grid.

``GridDimension = 38 22 22``

  Dimensions, *including* ghost zones.

``GridStartIndex = 3 3 3``

  The first index of data values *owned* by this grid.

``GridEndIndex = 34 18 18``

  The final index *owned* by this grid. The active zones have
  dimensionality of GridEndIndex - GridStartIndex + 1.

``GridLeftEdge = 0 0 0``

  In code units, between ``DomainLeftEdge`` and ``DomainRightEdge``,
  the origin of this grid.

``GridRightEdge = 1 0.5 0.5``

  In code units, between ``DomainLeftEdge`` and ``DomainRightEdge``,
  the right-edge of this grid. ``dx = (GridRightEdge -
  GridLeftEdge)/(GridEndIndex - GridStartIndex + 1)``.


``Time = 646.75066015177``

  The current time to which the baryon values in this grid have been
  evolved.


``SubgridsAreStatic = 0``

  Whether refinement can occur in the subgrids.

``NumberOfBaryonFields = 8``

  The number of data fields associated with this grid.

``FieldType = 0 1 4 5 6 19 20 21``

  The integer identifiers of each field, in order, inside this grid.

``BaryonFileName = ./RD0005/RedshiftOutput0005.cpu0000``

  The HDF5 file in which the baryons fields are stored.

``CourantSafetyNumber = 0.300000``

  Courant safety number for this grid (governs timestepping.)

``PPMFlatteningParameter = 0``

  Flattening parameter for this grid (governs PPM hydro.)

``PPMDiffusionParameter = 0``

  Diffusion parameter for this grid (governs PPM hydro.)

``PPMSteepeningParameter = 0``

  Steepening parameter for this grid (governs PPM hydro.)

``NumberOfParticles = 20``

  How many particles are located in this grid at this timestep.

``ParticleFileName = ./RD0005/RedshiftOutput0005.cpu0000``

  The HDF5 file in which the baryon fields and particle data are
  stored.  This field will not exist if there aren't any particles in
  the grid.

``GravityBoundaryType = 0``

   Boundary type inside gravity solver.
